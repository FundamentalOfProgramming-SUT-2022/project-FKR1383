First Day:
For first day I just add a command (create file (Careate file :))) ) in my VIM.
I use "invalid command" for all commands that start with createfile but it's incomplete or has wrong syntax.
Note : When my code executed, a folder "root" will be created beside the .exe file

Second day:
Insertstr is halfly completed; but some bugs and (\n -- \\n) is remaining
